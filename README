sqlsus has been designed to work on Linux. If it works on other platforms, that's good.
If it doesn't work on your platform, well.. grab a Linux box.

You will need the following perl modules :

    * LWP::UserAgent
    * DBD::SQLite
    * HTML::LinkExtractor
    * LWP::Protocol::socks (for socks proxy support)

And a proper Term::ReadLine package is definitely recommended (yet not mandatory)

You will probably also want to install sqlite3, the command line interface for SQLite 3.

Or, if you are on a debian system :

apt-get install libwww-perl libdbd-sqlite3-perl libhtml-linkextractor-perl libterm-readline-gnu-perl liblwp-protocol-socks-perl sqlite3

It also requires previous SQL injection knowledge, and.. well.. a brain helps.
